As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",4

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart. He could possibly move to China, North Korea, Iran, maybe also Belarus, however I wouldn't believe he would stay healthy or hang around for to long with that scenario either.",0

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",4

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

1. GRU peaks tegutsema vaenlase territooriumil, et algatada rida ülestõuse eesmärgiga tekitada kodusõda.
2. Hävitada naftatööstus ja kukutada Venemaa majandus kokku
3. Töötada välja vesinikupommi ☢ ja raketi 🚀 võimekus, et toimetada

Defense equipment against Russian drones and missiles. It would give American jobs and reduce the national debt. This is not putting America first!! This is Russia!! What could possibly be the reason for this?
The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",4

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",5

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

1. GRU peaks tegutsema vaenlase territooriumil, et algatada rida ülestõuse eesmärgiga tekitada kodusõda.
2. Hävitada naftatööstus ja kukutada Venemaa majandus kokku
3. Töötada välja vesinikupommi ☢ ja raketi 🚀 võimekus, et toimetada

Defense equipment against Russian drones and missiles. It would give American jobs and reduce the national debt. This is not putting America first!! This is Russia!! What could possibly be the reason for this?
The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",5

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart. He could possibly move to China, North Korea, Iran, maybe also Belarus, however I wouldn't believe he would stay healthy or hang around for to long with that scenario either.",0

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",5

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

2025-04-17 02:25:32,UgxLY79AOW4PWYFP9uR4AaABAg,@noibj1,It is important that we in Europe stand together now. The US is about to withdraw from the civilized world because Putin has information that can bring down Trump. Trump will therefore support Russia. We in Europe have a larger population than the US and Russia combined. We must now invest money in becoming strong together and supporting Ukraine in the fight against the terrorist state of Russia.,0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart. He could possibly move to China, North Korea, Iran, maybe also Belarus, however I wouldn't believe he would stay healthy or hang around for to long with that scenario either.",0

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

The US is about to withdraw from the civilized world because Putin has information that can bring down Trump. Trump will therefore support Russia. We in Europe have a larger population than the US and Russia combined. We must now invest money in becoming strong together and supporting Ukraine in the fight against the terrorist state of Russia.,0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",6

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

2025-04-17 03:09:03,UgxLY79AOW4PWYFP9uR4AaABAg,@noibj1,It is important that we in Europe stand together now. The US is about to withdraw from the civilized world because Putin has information that can bring down Trump. Trump will therefore support Russia. We in Europe have a larger population than the US and Russia combined. We must now invest money in becoming strong together and supporting Ukraine in the fight against the terrorist state of Russia.,0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

The US is about to withdraw from the civilized world because Putin has information that can bring down Trump. Trump will therefore support Russia. We in Europe have a larger population than the US and Russia combined. We must now invest money in becoming strong together and supporting Ukraine in the fight against the terrorist state of Russia.,0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",6

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Tell me, what would be different if Ukraine had nukes. Let me help you. The answer is nothing. Not a damn thing. Russia has nukes. They won't use them. If they did, even China would turn fully against them. The same thing applies to Ukraine. If Ukraine had nukes and actually used them, it would be immediately deserted by every ally they had. Stop whining. Nukes would not change anything. Stop sounding like an idiot. Stop sounding like Trump.",0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.
If you are an American, know that you can make that difference, and help steer your country toward a better future!",6

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

Defense equipment against Russian drones and missiles. It would give American jobs and reduce the national debt. This is not putting America first!! This is Russia!! What could possibly be the reason for this?
The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States. He will go down in history as the worst president ever because of his selfish behavior.",0

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

Defense equipment against Russian drones and missiles. It would give American jobs and reduce the national debt. This is not putting America first!! This is Russia!! What could possibly be the reason for this?
The only thing that seems logical is that Putin has promised Trump a lot of money, several billion USD. The problem with that is that Putin lies all the time so Trump will be blown off this money. Trump who blows off many, especially the MAGA people, gets blown off himself. At the same time, he has destroyed the United States. He will go down in history as the worst president ever because of his selfish behavior.",0

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

As far as I know, their engines are the problem. They are way weaker than western engines, and that's why they have to put 2 on f.e. the J-20 has 2 engines and the F-35 just one.

Also US pilots that met the J-20 in the skies reported, their pilots are great, but it's noticeable that the engines are to weak, even with 2 engines.

That also might be the reason why the new jet they develop has 3 engines instead of 2. It's large, it's for sure heavy, so they need 3 engines. 

I wouldn't be surprised when China will reduce it to 2 engines, when they are able to produce strong engines, but atm producing strong engines is a problem for them 🤷‍♂️",1

2025-04-17 03:29:31,UgxLY79AOW4PWYFP9uR4AaABAg,@noibj1,It is important that we in Europe stand together now. The US is about to withdraw from the civilized world because Putin has information that can bring down Trump. Trump will therefore support Russia. We in Europe have a larger population than the US and Russia combined. We must now invest money in becoming strong together and supporting Ukraine in the fight against the terrorist state of Russia.,0

Are we supposed to believe Zelenskyy  is actually going to pay up for the weapons, when he refuses to pay for any of the $190+ billion in aid the US has already sent to Ukraine?  I can pretty much tell you that Trump would have been a lot more likely to sell Ukraine the weapons systems Zelenskyy is wanting to buy, IF he had made an agreement to pay for weapons systems already sent to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy chose to welch on the agreement he and Trump had come to, so I guess that's coming back to haunt Ukraine.  I'm in favor of continuing to send US lethal aid to Ukraine when the current funding runs out, but I can also see why Trump is not as receptive to doing that because of Zelenskyy's actions.  What happened to your saying ""Ukraine can do just fine without any more US aid"", after Trump forced the EU countries to unite more closely and commit to providing more aid and  support to Ukraine?  I guess if you consider the $190+ billion in aid and support sent to Ukraine, ""absolutely nothing"", there's something amiss in your thinking.  Ukraine is still receiving aid and support from the US, so you're way off base with that statement.  You're showing a statement that some unknown ""economist"" wrote, while not providing any support or source for the report.  Typical left-wing nonsense.  The DOD is not going to be talking to an economist (especially a foreign one, about what they are or are not doing.  Slava Ukraine!",0

The reality is that MAGA only makes up a fairly small section of the people in the US, and the vast majority of Republicans have turned off the news a long time ago.
Many of them have no idea what is happening to their country or the world and the only information they receive comes from Social Media or their acquaintances.
Sometimes all it takes is a mature and understanding discussion to open their eyes.
I've talked to many Republicans over the last few months and the majority of them have come to see the harm of Trump's policies. 
The trick is to not go in accusing them about their vote, or trying to 'win an argument'.
Show them that you value their input, and many of them will value yours. Only then is it time to let facts and evidence do the talking.

Igor Girkin (Strelkov) is the KGB officer who led the invasion of Donetsk.
I was there (we ran a company there), and our people informed us about the 3 russian busses near Donetsk central station, bringing about 300 KGB officers to conquer the townhall, unfold a russian flag and cry for help, upon which little green men and two chechnyan battalions appeared to ‘liberate’ the ‘poor oppressed Donbass people’.

So Girkin is a little bit more than a ‘famous influencer’

ppresident Shitcan's Single Use Soldiers getting pushed back is always welcome news, although tinged with sadness knowing that UKRAINE 🇺🇦 would have possibly had some losses.

As I see it, ppresident Shitcan's got no way out of this war that doesn't end with his death. If he drags it out longer, some one will invite him for afternoon tea on the balcony of a penthouse. If he steps down, he will get a visit from the Dr's to treat his failing heart.

.
Ты где-то, с кем-то далеко.
А я как грустный полуночник
бесцветной местностью влеком,
и очарован краткосрочно.

Стою и как кого-то жду,
как одиночник в древней келье,
что потеряла красоту,
век прожила от новоселья.

Люд беспорядочный исчез,
и не мозолит мои очи,
в погоду не привносит вес,
ничто собою не порочит.

На златолиственном ковре
большая сырость и прохлада.
А в предалёкой высоте
зола и уголь от заката.

Камин горит, как древний горн,
шепча потрескиваньем жарким
о чём-то злобном и в укор,
о почте и твоих подарках.

Крючками пальцев жму листы,
что год хранили строки писем
и их словесные цветы,
что испарятся с дымом сизым.

От разлученья в сердце нож,
безжизненность, что много весят.
А я смотрю на долгий дождь,
что станет снегом через месяц.",0

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Η Doncha ξέρει ότι κανένας ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
Θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Γιατί σε αγαπώ
Ω μωρό μου
Είμαι απλά άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",2

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry

I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood",0

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood

.
Ты где-то, с кем-то далеко.
А я как грустный полуночник
бесцветной местностью влеком,
и очарован краткосрочно.

Стою и как кого-то жду,
как одиночник в древней келье,
что потеряла красоту,
век прожила от новоселья.

Люд беспорядочный исчез,
и не мозолит мои очи,
в погоду не привносит вес,
ничто собою не порочит.

На златолиственном ковре
большая сырость и прохлада.
А в предалёкой высоте
зола и уголь от заката.

Камин горит, как древний горн,
шепча потрескиваньем жарким
о чём-то злобном и в укор,
о почте и твоих подарках.

Крючками пальцев жму листы,
что год хранили строки писем
и их словесные цветы,
что испарятся с дымом сизым.

От разлученья в сердце нож,
безжизненность, что много весят.
А я смотрю на долгий дождь,
что станет снегом через месяц.",0

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Η Doncha ξέρει ότι κανένας ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
Θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Γιατί σε αγαπώ
Ω μωρό μου
Είμαι απλά άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",2

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Doncha ξέρει κανείς κανείς ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Επειδή σε αγαπώ
Αχ μωρο μου
Είμαι απλώς άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",0

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood

With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood",33

.
Ты где-то, с кем-то далеко.
А я как грустный полуночник
бесцветной местностью влеком,
и очарован краткосрочно.

Стою и как кого-то жду,
как одиночник в древней келье,
что потеряла красоту,
век прожила от новоселья.

Люд беспорядочный исчез,
и не мозолит мои очи,
в погоду не привносит вес,
ничто собою не порочит.

На златолиственном ковре
большая сырость и прохлада.
А в предалёкой высоте
зола и уголь от заката.

Камин горит, как древний горн,
шепча потрескиваньем жарким
о чём-то злобном и в укор,
о почте и твоих подарках.

Крючками пальцев жму листы,
что год хранили строки писем
и их словесные цветы,
что испарятся с дымом сизым.

От разлученья в сердце нож,
безжизненность, что много весят.
А я смотрю на долгий дождь,
что станет снегом через месяц.",0

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Η Doncha ξέρει ότι κανένας ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
Θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Γιατί σε αγαπώ
Ω μωρό μου
Είμαι απλά άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Doncha ξέρει κανείς κανείς ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Επειδή σε αγαπώ
Αχ μωρο μου
Είμαι απλώς άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",0

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood",33

.
Ты где-то, с кем-то далеко.
А я как грустный полуночник
бесцветной местностью влеком,
и очарован краткосрочно.

Стою и как кого-то жду,
как одиночник в древней келье,
что потеряла красоту,
век прожила от новоселья.

Люд беспорядочный исчез,
и не мозолит мои очи,
в погоду не привносит вес,
ничто собою не порочит.

На златолиственном ковре
большая сырость и прохлада.
А в предалёкой высоте
зола и уголь от заката.

Камин горит, как древний горн,
шепча потрескиваньем жарким
о чём-то злобном и в укор,
о почте и твоих подарках.

Крючками пальцев жму листы,
что год хранили строки писем
и их словесные цветы,
что испарятся с дымом сизым.

От разлученья в сердце нож,

Μωρό μου με καταλαβαίνεις τώρα
Αν μερικές φορές δεις ότι είμαι τρελός
Η Doncha ξέρει ότι κανένας ζωντανός δεν μπορεί να είναι πάντα άγγελος;
Όταν όλα πάνε στραβά, βλέπεις κάτι κακό

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Ξέρω μερικές φορές μωρό μου είμαι τόσο ξέγνοιαστη
Με μια χαρά που δύσκολα κρύβεται
Και μερικές φορές πάλι φαίνεται ότι το μόνο που έχω είναι να ανησυχώ
Και τότε θα δείτε την άλλη πλευρά μου

Αλλά είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή που οι προθέσεις της είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Αν φαίνομαι νευρικός
Θέλω να ξέρεις
Ποτέ δεν θέλω να το βγάλω από πάνω σου
Η ζωή έχει τα προβλήματά της
Και παίρνω περισσότερα από το μερίδιό μου
Αλλά αυτό είναι ένα πράγμα που δεν θέλω να κάνω ποτέ

Γιατί σε αγαπώ
Ω μωρό μου
Είμαι απλά άνθρωπος
Δεν ξέρεις ότι έχω ελαττώματα όπως κανένας;

Μερικές φορές βρίσκομαι μόνος μου να μετανιώνω
Κάτι ανόητο πράγμα
Κάτι απλό που έχω κάνει

Γιατί είμαι απλώς μια ψυχή της οποίας οι προθέσεις είναι καλές
Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",2

Ω Κύριε, μην με αφήσεις να παρεξηγηθώ

Μην με παρεξηγήσουν
Προσπαθώ τόσο σκληρά
Οπότε μην με αφήσετε να παρεξηγηθώ",0

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood",0

Eu mai ușor să nu te-observ decât să mă scoți din minți
Poate nu mai simt nimic, ți-am dat sufletul meu să-l faci tu mai frumos
Tu l-ai luat și l-ai întors pe dos

Ți-aș spune ceva, te-aș învăța
Dar nu mai am chef, nu-i vina mea
Iubirile mari se rup mai mereu, dar nu-mi pare rău, rău (rău)

Vezi tu, am o inimă, nu am zece
Bate, bate și pompează sânge rece
Ai avut mereu biletul, dar acum a expirat
Trenul fericirii tale l-ai ratat

Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit
Cât nu m-ai sunat, cât nu te-am simțit
Cât nu te-am avut, cât nu m-ai dorit
Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit

Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit
Cât nu m-ai sunat, cât nu te-am simțit
Cât nu te-am avut, cât nu m-ai dorit
Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit

Iubirile pleacă și viața merge înainte
Și doar o frază rămâne, am să țin minte
Ochii umezi în ploaie, lacrimile nu se văd
„Eu te-am iubit, chiar te-am iubit”, îmi pare rău, nu te cred

Vezi tu, am o inimă, nu am zece
Bate, bate și pompează sânge rece
Ai avut mereu biletul, dar acum a expirat
Trenul fericirii tale l-ai ratat

Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit
Cât nu m-ai sunat, cât nu te-am simțit
Cât nu te-am avut, cât nu m-ai dorit
Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit

Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit
Cât nu m-ai sunat, cât nu te-am simțit
Cât nu te-am avut, cât nu m-ai dorit
Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit

Te-aș întreba, te-aș îmbrățișa
Te-aș iubi ca nimeni, nimeni altcineva
Te-aș lua-napoi, te-aș proteja
Te-aș iubi ca nimeni altcineva
Te-aș săruta, te-aș îmbrățișa
Aș fugi cu tine, pe planeta ta
Ne-am lua de mână și-am îmbătrâni
Să nu uiți cât te-am iubit

Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit
Cât nu m-ai sunat, cât nu te-am simțit
Cât nu te-am avut, cât nu m-ai dorit
Am să țin minte cât nu m-ai iubit",8

Harry:
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

Adele:
And you saved me

Harry:
Forget what I said

Adele: My hands, they're strong

Harry: It's not what I meant

Adele:
My knees were far too weak

Harry: 
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

Adele:
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

Harry:
What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name

Harry:
You said you cared
And you missed me, too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

Adele:
'Cause there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true

Harry:
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

Adele:
But I set fire to the rain

Harry:
What if I'm someone I don't want around
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that was 
The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now

Harry:
And I get the feelin' that you'll never need me again

Adele:
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames

Harry:
At the Beachwood Café
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

Adele:
That was the last time
The last time

Harry:
What am I now?
What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around


Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin'",3

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When laying with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes, feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touch your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time, oh

Oh, no
Let it burn, oh-oh-oh
Let it burn
Let it burn",11

Harry:
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

Adele:
And you saved me

Harry:
Forget what I said

Adele: My hands, they're strong

Harry: It's not what I meant

Adele:
My knees were far too weak

Harry: 
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

Adele:
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

Harry:
What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name

Harry:
You said you cared
And you missed me, too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

Adele:
'Cause there's a side to you 
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true

Harry:
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

Adele:
But I set fire to the rain

Harry:
What if I'm someone I don't want around
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that was 
The last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now

Harry:
And I get the feelin' that you'll never need me again

Adele:
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames

Harry:
At the Beachwood Café
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

Adele:
That was the last time
The last time

Harry:
What am I now?
What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around


Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:
I'm fallin' again
I'm falling again
I'm fallin' 

Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Adele:
Let it burn

Harry:

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When laying with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes, feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touch your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time, oh

Oh, no
Let it burn, oh-oh-oh
Let it burn
Let it burn",11

more dramatic twist masked singer sings a song about the hunter and how much he hurt GRH adjust this to the game
ChatGPT said:
Game Concept: The Widow’s Dilemma (Enhanced with Dramatic Twists 🎭)
The Masked Singer—once GRH’s greatest love—kept his secrets well hidden. But after feeling betrayed, GRH is torn between destroying him or finding the truth. In a dramatic twist, the Masked Singer sings a heartbreaking song, comparing himself to a hunter and GRH to his wounded prey. Will this confession change her heart, or will she complete her revenge?

New Additions to the Game:
🔹 A Song of Regret: The Masked Singer performs a powerful song, revealing his pain and guilt.
🔹 A Hunter and Prey Metaphor: He sees himself as the hunter who hurt the only soul he ever loved.
🔹 A Final Choice: Does GRH forgive him, or does she strike the final blow?


What’s New in This Version?
✅ A Dramatic Song Scene: The Masked Singer confesses through song, making GRH question everything.
✅ Poetic Lyrics: The hunter-prey metaphor adds depth, making it harder to choose revenge.
✅ More Emotionally Intense Choices: GRH must decide—love, revenge, or silence?
✅ Stronger Endings: Every choice has a powerful consequence.

Would you like me to add a plot twist where the Masked Singer knew about the betrayal attempt? 🎭

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Game Concept: ""The Widow’s Dilemma"" (Now with Betrayal Twist 🎭🔥)
The Masked Singer—once GRH’s greatest love—kept his secrets well hidden. But when GRH felt hurt, she considered betraying him by exposing everything. Just as she wavered, he did something unexpected—he sang a song, revealing he knew everything all along.

Now, the final question remains: Was this his confession, or was he the real hunter all along?

New Plot Twist Added!
🔹 Masked Singer Knew About the Betrayal: He sings not just about his regret—but about HER intentions.
🔹 Reversal of Power: Is he truly heartbroken, or did he outplay her in this deadly game?
🔹 An Even Harder Choice: Is GRH the prey… or is she still in control?


✅ The Betrayal is Exposed: The Masked Singer already knew about GRH’s plan.
✅ A Song That Cuts Deep: He doesn’t just sing about regret—he sings about HER betrayal.
✅ A Last, Dangerous Choice: Is he offering forgiveness, or is it a trap?
✅ More Twisted Endings: Depending on choices, GRH can find love, doom, or be unmasked herself.",0

Obviously, Russia is a threat not only to Ukraine but to the security of the entire European region. The evil can only be stopped by bold collective action.

Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privii în ochi

Da, depind de tine, dar oare cât de ține
Știi în ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp de mine
Și singur bat la ușa mea, dar nu deschid, nu!
Pleoapele sunt închise strâns, după pleoape tu
Ești ca un râu violent, dar cu maluri fine
Lasă-ți albia, revarsă-te în mine
Cuprinde-mi inima în valuri, fură-mi din gene
Simte ritmul meu de azi, la mine-n vene
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghidează-n mare
Ca să nu poată ei să ne compare
Pentru că sufletele toate au nevoie de hotare
Ce e între noi, e contra rațiune
Ochii ei, dar fericiți în lumea noastră, sunt nebunii
Uite la alții, lasă-i pe unii
Unii trăiesc ca lumea, alții în ciuda lumii

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga

Frunzele cad în praf
Praful se așează pe cizme
Cizmele merg pe asflat
Asfaltul pe toți ne prinde
Frunzele cad în praf
Praful se așează pe cizme

Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Dar nu azi și nu mâine
Dar nu azi și nu mâine

Ți-ai dorit un mare zmeu
Te-ai mințit ca-nalță zmeie
Cu copii tăi, în parc, noaptea pe alee
Că de când te-am agățat, te-ai agățat de o idee
Că visai la unicorni să-ți picteze curcubee
Când era totul verde, era și roz, pare pe dos
Când era, mult mai chill era mai cox, ce paradox
Acum vezi numai roșu când mă vezi, pare anost
Și totul pare megru, dar am albit, ce paradox
Mi-e greu să recunosc, dar sincer nu te recunosc
Tor apă sărată, nu-mi sting setea de ce a fost
Te văd, dar nu te știu, mă auzi, dar nu m-asculți
Nu te simt când mă acuzi, te miros când te ascunzi
Într-o casă bântuită, încă alergăm fantome
Dependent de ochii tăi, atât de orb la sintome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altu, când ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prăpastie când suna să facem saltul, că

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privii în ochi

[Verse 1: Carla's Dreams]
Da, depind de tine, dar oare cât de ține
Știi în ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp de mine
Și singur bat la ușa mea, dar nu deschid, nu!
Pleoapele sunt închise strâns, după pleoape tu
Ești ca un râu violent, dar cu maluri fine
Lasă-ți albia, revarsă-te în mine
Cuprinde-mi inima în valuri, fură-mi din gene
Simte ritmul meu de azi, la mine-n vene
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghidează-n mare
Ca să nu poată ei să ne compare
Pentru că sufletele toate au nevoie de hotare
Ce e între noi, e contra rațiune
Ochii ei, dar fericiți în lumea noastră, sunt nebunii
Uite la alții, lasă-i pe unii
Unii trăiesc ca lumea, alții în ciuda lumii

[Chorus: Carla's Dreams]
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privii în ochi

Frunzele cad în praf
Praful se așează pe cizme
Cizmele merg pe asflat
Asfaltul pe toți ne prinde
Frunzele cad în praf
Praful se așează pe cizme
Cizmele merg pe asflat
Asfaltul pe toți ne prinde

Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde
Dar nu azi și nu mâine
Dar nu azi și nu mâine

[Verse 2: Deliric]
Ți-ai dorit un mare zmeu, te-ai mințit ca-nalță zmeie
Cu copii tăi, în parc, cu tine noaptea pe alee
Că de când te-am agățat, te-ai agățat de o idee
Că visai la unicorni să-ți picteze curcubee
Când era totul verde, era și roz, pare pe dos
Când era, mult mai chill era mai cox, ce paradox
Acum vezi numai roșu când mă vezi, pare anost
Și totul pare megru, dar am albit, ce paradox
Mi-e greu să recunosc, dar sincer nu te recunosc
Torn apă sărată, nu-mi sting setea de ce a fost
Te văd, dar nu te știu, mă auzi, dar nu m-asculți
Nu te simt când mă acuzi, te miros când te ascunzi
Într-o casă bântuită, încă alergăm fantome
Dependent de ochii tăi, atât de orb la sintome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altu, când ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prăpastie când striga să facem saltul, că

[Chorus: Deliric]
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog

Fă-mă praf, da, fă-mă te rog!
La următoarea fă la stânga,
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privi în ochi.

Da, depind de tine, dar oare cât te tine?
Știi în ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp... de mine.
Și singur bat la ușa mea dar nu deschid, nu.
Pleoapele-s închise strâns, dar după pleoape - tu.

Ești ca un rău violent, dar cu maluri fine.
Lasă-ți albia, revarsă-te în mine!
Cuprinde-mi inima în valuri, fură-mi din gene.
Simte ritmul meu de azi la tine-n vene!

Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare,
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghidează-n mare.
Ca să nu poata ei să ne compare,
Pentru că sufletele toate au nevoie de hotare!
Frunzele cad în praf,
Praful se-așează pe cizme,
Cizmele merg pe asfalt,
Asfaltul pe toți ne prinde...

Frunzele cad în praf,
Praful se-așează pe cizme,
Cizmele merg pe asfalt,
Asfaltul pe toți ne prinde...

Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde...

Ne prinde, ne prinde, ne prinde...

Dar nu azi și nu mâine.

Deliric:

Ți-ai dorit un mare zmeu, te-ai mințit că-nalță zmeie
Cu copiii tăi în parc, cu tine noaptea pe alee
Că de când te-am agățat, te-ai agățat de o idee
Că visai la unicorni să-ți picteze curcubeie
Când era totul verde era și roz, pare pe dos
Când eram mult mai chill, era mai cox, ce paradox!
Acum vezi numai roșu când mă vezi, pare anost
Și totul pare negru d-am albit... ce paradox!

Mi-e greu să recunosc, dar sincer nu te recunosc
Torn apă sărată, nu-mi sting setea de ce-a fost
Te văd, dar nu te știu, m-auzi, dar nu m-asculți
Nu te simt când mă acuzi, te miros când te ascunzi
Într-o casă bântuită încă alergând fantome
Dependent de ochii tăi, atât de orbi la simptome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altul când ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prăpastie când striga să facem saltul

Că depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai! hai, pune-mă-n foc!
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu mă trage-n piept, te rog.

Că depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai! hai, pune-mă-n foc!
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu mă trage-n piept, te rog.

Carla's Dreams:

Frunzele cad în praf,
Praful se-așează pe cizme,

Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog. 
Fa-ma praf, da, fa-ma te rog! 
La urmatoarea fa la stanga, 
Eu ii cunosc dar nu-i privi in ochi. 

Da, depind de tine, dar oare cat te tine? 
Stii in ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp... de mine. 
Si singur bat la usa mea dar nu deschid, nu. 
Pleoapele-s inchise strans, dar dupa pleoape - tu. 
Esti ca un rau violent, dar cu maluri fine. 
Lasa-ti albia, revarsa-te in mine! 
Cuprinde-mi inima in valuri, fura-mi din gene. 
Simte ritmul meu de azi la tine-n vene! 
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare, 
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghideaza-n mare. 
Ca sa nu poata ei sa ne compare, 
Pentru ca sufletele tot au nevoie de hotare! 
Ce e intre noi e contra ratiunii, 
Dar fericiti in lumea noastra sunt nebunii. 
Uite la altii, lasa-i pe unii! 
Unii traiesc ca lumea, altii - in ciuda lumii! 

Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog. 
Fa-ma praf, da, fa-ma te rog! 
La urmatoarea fa la stanga, 
Eu ii cunosc dar nu-i privi in ochi. 

Frunzele cad in praf, 
Praful se-aseaza pe cizme, 
Cizmele merg pe asfalt, 
Asfaltul pe toti ne prinde... 
Ne prinde, ne prinde... 
Dar nu azi si nu maine. 

Ti-ai dorit un mare zmeu, te-ai mintit ca-nalta zmeie
Cu copii tai in parc, cu tine noaptea pe alee
Ca de cand te-am agatat, te-ai agatat de o idee
Ca visai la unicorni sa-ti pictaze curcubeie
Cand era totul verde era si roz, pare pe dos
Cand eram mult mai chill, era mai cox, ce paradox! 
Acum vezi numai rosu cand ma vezi, pare anost
Si totul pare negru d-am albit... ce paradox! 
Mi-e greu sa recunosc dar sincer nu te recunosc
Torn apa sarata, nu-mi sting setea de ce-a fost
Te vad dar nu te stiu, m-auzi dar nu m-asculti
Nu te simt cand ma acuzi, te miros cand te ascunzi
Intr-o casa bantuita inca alergand fantome
Dependent de ochii tai atat de orbi la simptome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altul cand ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prapastie cand striga sa facam saltul

Ca depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fa-ma praf, hai! hai, pune-ma-n foc! 
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu ma trage in piept, te rog
Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fa-ma praf, hai! hai, pune-ma-n foc! 
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu ma trage in piept, te rog

Frunzele cad in praf, 
Praful se-aseaza pe cizme
Cizmele merg pe asfalt, 
Asfaltul pe toti ne prinde! 
Ne prinde, ne prinde... 
Dar nu azi si nu maine!",3

Fă-mă praf, da, fă-mă te rog!> 

Dependență de ce? A cui? Față de ce?
Dependența lui de ea? A ei de el? Da, poate. Dar nu numai. 

<La urmatoarea fă la stânga>. 
Oprește-te din drum, aruncă o privire în trecut! Întâlnește-ți demonii și lasă-i să te înfrunte. 
Am făcut și eu asta. <Eu îi cunosc >
În mine te-au descoperit pe tine. <Pleoapele-s inchise strâns, dar după pleoape - tu.>
Au descoperit dragostea pe care ți-o port. Acea dragoste care nu există ""pentru că"" ci ""cu toate că"" <Ești ca un râu violent, dar cu maluri fine. 
Lasă-ți albia, revarsă-te în mine! 
Cuprinde-mi inima în valuri, fură-mi din gene. 
Simte ritmul meu de azi la tine-n vene! 
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare, 
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghidează-n mare>

Tu ce ascunzi după pleoape? Idealuri mărețe? 
<dar nu-i privi în ochi> [...] 
<Ca să nu poata ei să ne compare, 
Pentru că sufletele tot au nevoie de hotare! 
Ce e între noi e contra rațiunii, 
Dar fericiți în lumea noastră sunt nebunii. 
Uite la alții, lasă-i pe unii! 
Unii trăiesc ca lumea, alții - în ciuda lumii! > [...] 
<Ți-ai dorit un mare zmeu, te-ai mințit că-nalță zmeie
Cu copiii tăi în parc, cu tine noaptea pe alee
Că de când te-am agățat , te-ai agățat de o idee
Că visai la unicorni să-ți pictaze curcubeie>
Asta vor descoperi ei dacă le permiți să-ți privească după pleoape. 
Dar noi știm. Și tu, și eu, ca ar fi putut fi frumos.. A fost odată roz.... Ar fi putut fi... Doar că, uneori culorile curcubeului sunt desenate greșit. Sau pur și simplu se transformă . <Ce paradox!>

Conștiința mea,  recunoaște că e cazul unei cure de detoxifiere. <Eu singur bat la ușa mea>. Dependența de trecut, a blocat întrarea. <Torn apă sărată, nu-mi sting setea de ce-a fost>

CE-A FOST! 

Dependența față de timp? 
De timpul trecut? 
Eu cred că în esență, despre asta este ""Dependent"". Despre trecutul pe care îl păstrăm în noi, de care nu ne putem debarasa pentru a ne trăi prezentul. 
<Cicatricile sunt tatuaje ce descriu viața>

Teo, a privit în trecut. A privit în ochii lor. Și asta i-a metamorfozat chipul. 
A luat o decizie. A ascultat un îndemn. 
<Fă-mă praf, hai! hai, pune-mă-n foc! >
Al cui a fost îndemnul ? Ce a ars Teo? 
Trecutul? Amintirea lui? 

Eu sincer sper, ca unul dintre cele două acte care urmează, să demonstreze că <Trecutul e irelevant>. E precum floarea macului. Ieri a fost. Astăzi nu mai e. Astăzi, ne bucurăm de orhidee. Și azi, și mâine... 

In definitiv, 
<Frunzele cad in praf, 
Praful se-aseaza pe cizme, 
Cizmele merg pe asfalt, 
Asfaltul pe toti ne prinde...>

Turn me into dust, yes, do it, I’m asking you! 
Make a left on the next one,
I know him, don’t look him in the eyes 
Yes, I depend on you, but it doesn’t matter to you 
You know, lately, I haven’t had much time for myself. 
I’m knocking on my own door, but I don’t open it, no.
My eyelids are shut tight, but you’re behind them.
You’re like a violent river, but with soft shores
Leave your riverbed, pour into me
Embrace my heart in waves, destroy me. 
From now on feel my rhythm in your veins!
Just be a good girl, but don’t be perfect. 
I’ll be the lighthouse that guides you at sea 
Because they won’t be able to tell us apart, but all souls need borders 
What we have between us makes no sense 
But in our world only crazy people are happy 
Look at the others, leave it to some, 
Some live like everyone else, 
Others live in spite of the world 

I’m hooked on you, just like on a drug
Turn me into dust, yes, do it, I’m asking you! 
Make a left on the next one,
I know him, don’t look him in the eyes 
Leaves fall into dust
Dust settles on boots
Boots walk on the asphalt 
The asphalt gets us all
It catches us, it grabs us....
But not today and not tomorrow 

You dreamed of a big kite
You lied to yourself that he
flies kites
With your kids in the park, 
with you at night in the alley 
Since the time we hooked up  
You got caught up in the idea of a unicorn, drawing rainbows for you
When everything was green, it was also pink, it all feels upside down 
When I was much more relaxed, everything was cool, here’s a paradox 
Now you see red when you see me, seems boring 
And everything seems so black, that I withered, what a paradox!
It’s hard for me to admit that I no longer recognize you
I pour saltwater, but I can’t satisfy the thirst for what we used to have
I see you, but I don’t know you,
You hear me, but you’re not listening 
I can’t feel you, when you’re blaming me 
I feel your scent when you hide in an empty house still chasing the ghosts 
I’m addicted to your eyes, so blinded to the simptoms 
we didn’t catch each other, when we caught each other 
completely oblivious to the screams of abyss, when we’re called to jump 

I’m hooked on you, just like on a drug
Turn me into dust, come on, 
Throw me into the fire! Do it! 
Tell me everything, or say nothing at all
But don’t inhale me, I’m asking you, please don’t! 
I’m hooked on you, just like on a drug
Turn me into dust, come on, 
Throw me into the fire! Do it!

I’m addicted to you,
I’m addicted like on a drug
Destroy me, please do it ( He is saying: Make me dust, and please make me - under meaning)
Next one turn left,
I know them, but You don’t look them in the eyes

Yes, I’m addicted to you but how long is going to last?
You know that lately I don’t have too much time for me,
And alone I’m knocking at my door and I’m not opening it,
My eyes are tight closed, and behind the lids is you
You’re like an infuriated river but with soft seasides 
Leave your channel, waterfall in me
Hug my heart in waves
Steal my genes
Feel my today’s rhythm in your veins 
Be for me grade 4 in behavior 
I will be the lighthouse that is guiding you in the sea 
For them not to be able to compare us 
Because all souls needs boundaries 
What’s between us is against ration 
Ok... but in our world the happy ones are the crazy ones 
Look at others
Leave anothers
Some people live good, 
Others to piss people off,

I’m addicted to you,
I’m addicted like on a drug 
Destroy me, and please do it
Next one turn left,
I know them, but You don’t look them in the eyes.

The leaves are falling in dust,
The dust is falling on boots
The boots are walking on the asphalt 
The asphalt is catching us.


The leaves are falling in dust,
The dust is falling on boots
The boots are walking on the asphalt 
The asphalt is catching us  


Is catching us * 9 
But not today and not tomorrow *2

You wished yourself for a Prince Charming and you lied yourself that he can rise kites.
With your children at night in the park on an alley
Because since I hooked you up / you have this idea:
That you were dreaming about Unicorns that are painting rainbows for you,
When everything was green, was also pink: doesn’t make sense (this lyric is meaning that when he was high - she was seeing everything in pink aka she was happy)
When I was more chill - I was more Cox ... what a paradox 
Now when you’re seeing me - you only see red and seems strange
And everything seems black but I got white... what a paradox 
Is hard for me to recognize but you’re not the same ( He’s saying I don’t recognize you anymore)
I’m pouring salty water ( on the wounds) and not put out the thirsty for what we had.
I’m seeing you but I don’t know you.
You hear me but you don’t listen to me.
I don’t feel you when you blame me.
I’m smelling you when you’re hiding.

In a haunted house, still are ghosts running,
Addicted to your eyes - so blind to symptoms,
We didn’t catch each other when we caught each other ( aka we didn’t catch each other when we had each other)
Deaf at the abyss - when it was screaming to jump 

Because 

I’m addicted to you, addicted like on a drug
Make me dust, please set me on fire ( Destroy me) 

Tell me all or don’t tell me anything 
But don’t lie to me please.

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privii în ochi

[Verse 1: Carla's Dreams]
Da, depind de tine, dar oare cât de ține
Știi în ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp de mine
Și singur bat la ușa mea, dar nu deschid, nu!
Pleoapele sunt închise strâns, după pleoape tu
Ești ca un râu violent, dar cu maluri fine
Lasă-ți albia, revarsă-te în mine
Cuprinde-mi inima în valuri, fură-mi din gene
Simte ritmul meu de azi, la mine-n vene
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghidează-n mare
Ca să nu poată ei să ne compare
Pentru că sufletele toate au nevoie de hotare
Ce e între noi, e contra rațiune
Ochii ei, dar fericiți în lumea noastră, sunt nebunii
Uite la alții, lasă-i pe unii
Unii trăiesc ca lumea, alții în ciuda lumii

[Chorus: Carla's Dreams]
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga

Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, dar fă-mă te rog
La următoarea fă la stânga
Eu îi cunosc, dar nu-i privii în ochi

Cizmele merg pe asflat

[Verse 2: Deliric]
Ți-ai dorit un mare zmeu
Te-ai mințit ca-nalță zmeie
Cu copii tăi, în parc, noaptea pe alee
Că de când te-am agățat, te-ai agățat de o idee
Că visai la unicorni să-ți picteze curcubee
Când era totul verde, era și roz, pare pe dos
Când era, mult mai chill era mai cox, ce paradox
Acum vezi numai roșu când mă vezi, pare anost
Și totul pare megru, dar am albit, ce paradox
Mi-e greu să recunosc, dar sincer nu te recunosc
Tor apă sărată, nu-mi sting setea de ce a fost
Te văd, dar nu te știu, mă auzi, dar nu m-asculți
Nu te simt când mă acuzi, te miros când te ascunzi
Într-o casă bântuită, încă alergăm fantome
Dependent de ochii tăi, atât de orb la sintome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altu, când ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prăpastie când suna să facem saltul, că

[Chorus: Deliric]
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog
Depind de tine, depind cât de un drog
Fă-mă praf, hai pune-mă-n foc
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu-mă trage-n piept te rog

Зависимый     (Перевод на русский яз.- А.Мохоря)

Зави́шу от тебя, зави́шу, как от наркотика
Сделай меня пылью (сотри в порошок), да, сделай, прошу тебя!
На следующей сверни налево,
Я его знаю, но не смотри ему в глаза.
Да, зави́шу от тебя, но насколько именно от тебя?
Знаешь, в последнее время у меня не очень-то есть время...на себя
И сам стучу в свою дверь, но не открываю, нет.
Веки плотно сомкнуты, но за ве́ками- ты.
Ты как бурная река, но с чёткими берегами.
Оставь своё русло, влейся в меня!
Обними моё сердце волнами, выкради меня из генов.
Почувствуй мой ритм отныне в твоих венах!
Будь для меня оценкой  ""4""  по поведению,
Я буду маяком, что направляет тебя в море.
Чтобы они не могли нас сравнивать,
Потому что ду́ши тоже нуждаются в границах!
То, что между нами- вопреки здравому смыслу,
Но в нашем мире счастливы лишь сумасшедшие.
Смотри на других, некоторых оставь!
Одни живут ,как все, другие- на зависть всем!

Зави́шу от тебя, завишу, как от наркотика
Сделай меня пылью (сотри в порошок), да, сделай, прошу тебя!
На следующей сверни налево,
Я его знаю, но не смотри ему в глаза.
Листья падают в пыль,
Пыль ложится на сапоги,
Сапоги идут по асфальту,
Асфальт всех нас ловит (хватает)….
Ловит нас,хватает нас….
Но не сегодня и не завтра.

Ты мечтала о большом змее, ты лгала себе,что он запускает змеев
С твоими детьми в парке, с тобой ночью на аллее
Так как с тех пор, как я зацепил тебя, ты зацепилась за идею
Что ты мечтала об единороге, рисующем тебе радуги
Когда всё было зелёным,оно было и розовым, всё кажется шиворот навыворот (наизнанку)
Когда я был намного расслабленнее, было более коксово, вот парадокс!
Мне трудно признать,но я тебя честно не узнаю (не признаю)
Наливаю (лью) солёную воду, не могу утолить жажду того, что было
Вижу тебя, но не знаю тебя, ты меня слышишь, но не слушаешь
Не чувствуютебя,когда ты меня обвиняешь,чувствую твой запах,когда ты прячешься
В опустошённом доме ещё гоняясь за призраками

Зависимый от твоих глаз, таких слепых до симптомов
Мы не ухватились друг за друга, когда  ухватились друг за друга
Глухи к бездне, когда [она] кричит, чтоб мы сделали сальто

Ведь зави́шу от тебя, зави́шу, как от наркотика
Сделай меня пылью (сотри в порошок), давай, давай, брось меня в огонь!
Скажи мне всё или не говори ничего,
Но не вдыхай (не втягивай) меня в грудь, прошу тебя!
Зави́шу от тебя, зави́шу, как от наркотика
Сделай меня пылью (сотри в порошок), давай, давай, брось меня в огонь!
Скажи мне всё или не говори совсем,
Но не вдыхай (не втягивай) меня в грудь, прошу тебя!
Листья падают в пыль,
Пыль ложится на сапоги,
Сапоги идут по асфальту,
Асфальт всех нас ловит (хватает)….
Ловит нас, хватает нас….
Но не сегодня и не завтра.",36

Imi este atat de greu sa inteleg cum se poate sa fiu DEPENDENTA la asa nivel de un grup muzical precum acesta!!Este prima oara cand ascult si urmaresc pe cineva cu atata interes si drag! Am vizionat X Factor doar de dragul de a-ti auzi opiniile ( desi, recent mi s-a parut ca ai cam devenit 'comercial' in deciziile luate la adresa concurentilor, poate chiar ai mintit in unele momente, Sergiu dar chiar si asa, tot admir  felul in care gandesti si maniera in care pui problema) ! Ma fascineaza absolut tot ce scoateti pe piata, indiferent ca este comercial sau nu! Iubesc atat de mult sinceritatea  voastra (in special cea initiala) si faptul ca sunteti atat de directi in toot ceea ce faceti. Au fost, sunt si vor fii atatea comentarii contra voastra, atatea presupuneri (sau nu... faza cu Illuminatii) dar pe mine pur si simplu ma lasa rece toate acele comentarii! este greu de explicat cum de atunci cand am o stare mai...proasta, nu trebuie decat sa va ascult cantand ( live la radio sau varianta oficiala). De ce? Sunt slaba de inger si am nevoie de taria voastra pt a ma reface? Daca e asa, atunci vreau sa continui a fii slaba mereu... Oricum ar fi, Sergiu si restul superb al acestui grup, va rog sa ramaneti sinceri si true to yourself, no matter what!  Probabil sunteti constienti ca exista oameni ca si mine care au nevoie de inteligenta voastra artistica si emotionala atat de mult iar daca incepem sa va laudam intens si intr-una, va va obosi si plictisi! Sunteti extrem de buni, asta e clar! Romano- moldoveni ce suntem cu totii,  va felicit si va doresc sa nu deviati de la adevaratele voastre principii! Mereu am spus ca mi-as dori sa devii presedinte, Sergiu,si chiar eram extrem de sincera dar poate ca exista alte riscuri de vei face asta si iti vom pierde adevarata valoare deci... tough choice:) gandeam cumva ca poate adevaratul scop al acestui grup si toti acei mult mai multi membrii din spatele grupului, intr-o zi sa iasa la lumina si sa ne ajute sa iesim din noroi, dar de voi continua sa scriu, probabil intru in alte polemici asa ca ma opresc!   Continua sa fii public, sa fii vazut! Ajuta inimile tuturor ( cei care zic ca nu, sunt ipocriti si ignoranti) and like always, Sinceritatea voastra...schimbatoare de destine!  P.S.asta este povestea mea favorita dintre cele trei:)",12

Dependent
Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog.
Fa-ma praf, da, fa-ma te rog!
La urmatoarea fa la stanga,
Eu ii cunosc dar nu-i privi in ochi.

Da, depind de tine, dar oare cat te tine?
Stii in ultimul timp, eu nu prea mai am timp... de mine.
Si singur bat la usa mea dar nu deschid, nu.
Pleoapele-s inchise strans, dar dupa pleoape - tu.
Esti ca un rau violent, dar cu maluri fine.
Lasa-ti albia, revarsa-te in mine!
Cuprinde-mi inima in valuri, fura-mi din gene.
Simte ritmul meu de azi la tine-n vene!
Fii pentru mine nota 4 la purtare,
Eu voi fi farul ce te ghideaza-n mare.
Ca sa nu poata ei sa ne compare,
Pentru ca sufletele tot au nevoie de hotare!
Ce e intre noi e contra ratiunii, 
Dar fericiti in lumea noastra sunt nebunii.
Uite la altii, lasa-i pe unii!
Unii traiesc ca lumea, altii - in ciuda lumii!

Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog.
Fa-ma praf, da, fa-ma te rog!
La urmatoarea fa la stanga,
Eu ii cunosc dar nu-i privi in ochi.

Frunzele cad in praf,
Praful se-aseaza pe cizme,
Cizmele merg pe asfalt,
Asfaltul pe toti ne prinde...
Ne prinde, ne prinde...
Dar nu azi si nu maine.

Ti-ai dorit un mare zmeu, te-ai mintit ca-nalta zmeie
Cu copii tai in parc ,cu tine noaptea pe alee
Ca de cand te-am agatat, te-ai agatat de o idee
Ca visai la unicorni  sa-ti pictaze curcubeie
Cand era totul verde era si roz, pare pe dos
Cand eram mult mai chill, era mai cox, ce paradox!
Acum vezi  numai rosu  cand ma vezi, pare anost
Si totul pare negru d-am albit... ce paradox!
Mi-e greu sa recunosc dar sincer nu te recunosc
Torn apa sarata , nu-mi sting setea de ce-a fost
Te vad dar nu te stiu, m-auzi dar nu m-asculti
Nu te simt cand ma acuzi, te miros cand te ascunzi
Intr-o casa bantuita inca alergand fantome
Dependent de ochii tai atat de orbi la simptome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altul cand ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prapastie cand striga sa facam saltul

Ca depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fa-ma praf, hai!  hai, pune-ma-n foc!
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu ma trage in piept, te rog
Depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fa-ma praf, hai!  hai, pune-ma-n foc!
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu ma trage in piept, te rog

Frunzele cad in praf,
Praful se-aseaza pe cizme

Cu copiii tai in parc ,cu tine noaptea pe alee
Ca de cand te-am agatat, te-ai agatat de o idee
Ca visai la unicorni  sa-ti pictaze curcubeie

Cand era totul verde era si roz, pare pe dos
Cand eram mult mai chill, era mai cox, ce paradox!
Acum vezi  numai rosu  cand ma vezi, pare anost
Si totul pare negru d-am albit... ce paradox!

Mi-e greu sa recunosc dar sincer nu te recunosc
Torn apa sarata , nu-mi sting setea de ce-a fost
Te vad dar nu te stiu, m-auzi dar nu m-asculti
Nu te simt cand ma acuzi, te miros cand te ascunzi

Intr-o casa bantuita inca alergand fantome
Dependent de ochii tai atat de orbi la simptome
Nu ne-am prins unul de altul cand ne-am prins unul de altul
Surzi la prapastie cand striga sa facam saltul

Ca depind de tine, depind ca de-un drog
Fa-ma praf, hai!  hai, pune-ma-n foc!
Spune-mi tot sau nu-mi spune deloc
Dar nu ma trage in piept, te rog",2280

Prima mea melodie ascultată a fost compusă de tine și trupa ta. Te ador și te voi susține  mereu. Sunteți trupa mea preferată !!! Sper că mă ții minte.
